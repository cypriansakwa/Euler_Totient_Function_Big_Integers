This Rust program uses the num-bigint package to calculate Euler's Totient function, Ï†(n), for huge numbers. 
Euler's Totient function returns the number of positive integers up to n that are relatively prime to n.
The program contains
1.  Big Integer Support: Utilizes the num-bigint library to handle large integers..
2. Euler's Totient Function: Quickly computes the number of integers up to n that are coprime to n.
